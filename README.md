# Netplay Fork

This is a fork of [Xenia-Canary Netplay](https://github.com/craftycodie/sunrise-xenia-canary-netplay) which implements online multiplayer features.
It has been built from the ground up and tested primarily with Halo 3, though other games are supported.
In it's current state, the fork is very rough and not PR ready. Check out the [Issues](https://github.com/craftycodie/xenia-canary-netplay/issues) list for more on that.

The web API powering this fork can be found [here](https://github.com/AdrianCassar/Xenia-WebServices).

Massive thanks to @SarahGreyWolf for testing this fork with me for about a month, couldn't have done it without her.
Also, thank you to @Bo98 for creating the burnout5 xenia fork, I used that as a basis for this, and some of the code is still here I think.

Peace and hair grease

## Disclaimer

The goal of this project is to experiment, research, and educate on the topic
of emulation of modern devices and operating systems. **It is not for enabling
illegal activity**. All information is obtained via reverse engineering of
legally purchased devices and games and information made public on the internet
(you'd be surprised what's indexed on Google...).

## Quickstart

See the [Quickstart](https://github.com/xenia-project/xenia/wiki/Quickstart) page.

## Building

See [building.md](docs/building.md) for setup and information about the
`xb` script. When writing code, check the [style guide](docs/style_guide.md)
and be sure to run clang-format!

## Contributors Wanted!

Have some spare time, know advanced C++, and want to write an emulator?
Contribute! There's a ton of work that needs to be done, a lot of which
is wide open greenfield fun.

**For general rules and guidelines please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).**

Fixes and optimizations are always welcome (please!), but in addition to
that there are some major work areas still untouched:

* Help work through [missing functionality/bugs in games](https://github.com/xenia-project/xenia/labels/compat)
* Reduce the size of Xenia's [huge log files](https://github.com/xenia-project/xenia/issues/1526)
* Skilled with Linux? A strong contributor is needed to [help with porting](https://github.com/xenia-project/xenia/labels/platform-linux)

See more projects [good for contributors](https://github.com/xenia-project/xenia/labels/good%20first%20issue). It's a good idea to ask on Discord and check the issues page before beginning work on
something.
